# UI/UX - 1
## Contribution Guidelines
Each topic should be in a folder and folder name should be of  " Topic number Topic Name " in this format , 

for example, a contributor is assigned a topic from Module-1, say Definition of User Experience(UX)- so first contributor will create a folder (in the given module folder (1.Introduction_to_UX_Design)) named 1.a_Design and similarly for What is Design? name will be 1.b._Design, so on...If there are sub-topics of the topics assigned to contributors name file like 1.a.i._Design and so on...

After creating the folder, create a markdown file  (file name as same foldername) within the folder you created in previous step and add the theory or explanation part there regarding the topic assigned. Also, contributors need to add images, code files or designs used if any inside that folder only.

Contributors assigned with topics should follow the same procedure and should only push to the the correct folder i.e. UI/UX-1 and correct sub-folders as well.
