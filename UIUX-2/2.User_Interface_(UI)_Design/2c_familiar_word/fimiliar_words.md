This article is dedicated to designers and the people who have to communicate with them. Of course, if you go into any design studio, 99% of what you see will be drawings. But probably 100% of what you hear in the studio will be words.
The UI/UX Glossary for Designers is a valuable bag of tricks that will teach you to speak the same language as designers. This short article provides you with better understanding of key UI/UX terminology.
Terms for UI and UX Designers

### 

## · User Experience (UX)

A broad term that includes several disciplines that study the effect of design on the ease of use and level of satisfaction with a product, site or system. The term UX was invented by Dr. Donald Norman, a cognitive scientist.

## · User Experience Design (UXD)

Designing software products and systems to be useful to a set of end users. It is a broad concept applied during the design process.  UX design covers the technical use of a product or service and its essential physical interface.

## · Customer Experience

The feelings of a customer generated by his or her interactions with a supplier’s employees, systems, channels or products.

## · User Interface (UI), or Graphical User Interface (GUI)

What the user sees. This can be a set of commands or menus through which a user communicates with a program. It is also the space where interactions between humans and machines occurs.

## · Interaction Design (IXD)

The study of how a user interacts with a page, application or product. IXD facilitates the actions we want to take with any given system.

## · 3-click Rule
The theory that users will abandon a website if they are unable to complete their task within 3 mouse clicks.
### · 5-Second Test
A technique that involves showing users a single content page for a quick 5 seconds to gather their initial impressions. Users make important judgments in the first moments when they visit a page. It gives the team insight into essential information about the page.

## · F-Shaped Pattern

Users often read Web pages in an F-shaped pattern: two horizontal stripes, followed by a vertical stripe. In a few seconds, their eyes will move at amazing speed across your website’s words in a one-of-a-kind pattern.

## · Sketching
 
A drawing which designers use to propose, explore, refine and communicate ideas. As a UX designer, you too can use sketching as your first line of attack to crack a design problem.

## · Wireframe
 A simplified sketch of the important information on a page. Also known as page architecture, page schematic, or a blueprint. Basically, it’s a skeleton of the design and should contain all the important elements of the final product.

## · Mockup
 
A medium or highly detailed static representation of the design. A good mockup demonstrates the information structure, content and basic functionality in static form. Moreover, mockups make it easy to perceive the idea of the final product, and the process of mockup creation is less time-consuming compared to prototypes.

## · Prototype
 
Often confused with a wireframe, a prototype is a medium or a highly detailed representation of the final product. It simulates user interaction with the interface and allows the user to rate the content and interface and test the primary options for communication with the app. Though, prototype may not look exactly like the final product, but it should not be sketched in shades of Gray. In addition, interactions must be modelled in a way that closely mimic the final product.

## · 80/20 Rule
20% of the functionality and features in any environment will be responsible for 80% of the actions taken within that environment. 

## · A/B Testing
Determining which of two alternatives is preferred by the target audience.

## · Accessibility
The measure of a web page’s usability by persons with one or more disabilities.

## · Golden Ratio
 
A mathematical ratio with origins in ancient Greece, also known as the Greek letter Phi. It is found in nature, and has made its way into graphic and print design as people deem it to be the most visually appealing layout to the human eye. The Golden Ratio approximately equals 1.618. We find it when we divide a line into two parts so that the full length divided by the long part is equal to the long part divided by the short part.

## · Grid
A system of horizontal and vertical lines providing a structural basis for page layout and design. It communicates order, economy and consistency. The grid provides a common structure and flexibility for organizing content.

## · Micro-copy
The ubiquitous text that turns up in tiny chunks on a webpage or in an application when you need it. It can be the label on a field, a quick set of instructions on what button to push, etc. It’s the tiny text on which much of the product’s UX hinges. Micro-copy provides those just-in-time clear instructions.

## · 60-30-10 Rule
A timeless decorating rule that can help you put a color scheme together easily.  To put it short, the 60% + 30% + 10% proportion is meant to give balance to the colours used in any space.

## · Colour Contrast
 
The difference between two colours. Black and white create the highest contrast possible. Colour can contrast in hue, value and saturation. You usually want a high contrast between text and its background color. But too high contrast between design elements might give an unsettled and messy impression. Effective use of contrast is the essential ingredient that makes the content accessible to every viewer.

## · Colour Wheel
 
This circle shows the relationships between primary colours, secondary colours and tertiary colours. Artists and designers use red, yellow, and blue primaries arranged at three equally spaced points around their colour wheel.

## · Corporate Identity Guideline
Defines how your company’s brand, image and messaging are delivered to the public and particularly to your key audiences. The corporate identity guideline positions the company, no matter how big or small. The rules for consistent typography, colour use, and logo placement are all laid out in the corporate identity manual.

## · Web Analytics
The measurement, collection, and analysis of the internet to understand and optimize web usage.
 
## · Clickstream Analysis
A form of Web analytics. Clickstream analysis is the tracking and analysis of visits to websites. This analysis reports user behaviour such as routing, stickiness, where users come from and where they go from the site.

## · Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
MVP is a product with enough features to meet the needs of early customers. This strategy provides feedback for future product development.

## · Mind map
A diagram used to visually organize information. A mindmap is hierarchical and shows the relationships among the parts of the whole. It is often created around a single concept to which associated images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those.

## · Customer Journey Map (CJM)
A tool companies use to see what their customers truly want. A customer journey map tells the story from initial contact through to engagement and the long-term relationship. It may focus on a particular part of the story, or give an overview of the entire user experience. It talks about the user’s feelings, motivations and questions for each of these touch points.

## · Onboarding
Designing a welcoming experience for new users by easing them into it. The design of the onboarding process for your site is usually limited to a first-time use scenario.

# · Data-driven
This means using all the available data: analytics, A/B tests, customer service logs and social media sentiment to develop a better understanding of UX. There are common misconceptions that user experience is purely an art, but there is a lot more involved. Understanding how to collect and process data is one of the key tasks you have to face as a UX designer.

## · Responsive Web Design (RWD)
RWD provides an optimal viewing experience across platforms and devices. The content and layout of a website should efficiently adapt to the sizes and technical abilities of the device it is opened on.

## · Information Architecture (IA)
The organizing of information, including site hierarchies, web content, labelling schemes and navigation. IA makes it easy for people to find, understand and manage information.
