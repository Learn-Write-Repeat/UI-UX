# Design Consistency - What, Why and How.

One of the definitions of “consistency” given by the Cambridge English Dictionary is the quality of always behaving or performing in a similar manner, or of always happening in a similar manner, aka “being the same.” That is perhaps the simplest way to put it. It denotes that the product communicates with the user in the same or similar manner, regardless of the point or channel of communication. In terms of user experience, it means that similar elements look and function similarly, reducing cognitive load and making interactions smoother and more intuitive.

- ### **WHY** is design consistency necessary?

    In a nutshell, a consistent approach to user experience design results in the following advantages:

    - The interface becomes much easier to learn for new users.
    - Fewer errors occur as users are less confused.
    - The cognitive load is reduced, saving users time and effort.

    As a result, consistency links various UI elements into a system of predictable and clear interactions. In fact, we do the same thing in the physical world to make our lives easier and avoid having to focus on the same operations over and over. For example, we all keep dishes and utensils in our kitchens, so even if you're visiting someone for the first time, you won't try to find a cup and a spoon in the bathroom just because it's the most common pattern.

- ### **WHAT** are the types of design consistency?

    At first glance, the entire interface appears to be the same on all screens. There are only a few subtle differences when carefully observed. As an example, consider the placement of navigational elements in the header. This is due to differences in the guidelines for both platforms. The elements that must be consistent throughout the interface are styling, placement, font preferences, and design. Moving or changing elements not only confuses your user, but it also disappoints them and may prompt them to uninstall your application.

    When aiming for a consistent user interface, you must be aware of the four types of consistency and the factors that influence them.

    - **Visual Consistency**

        When similar elements are perceived in the same way, we say that the user interface is visually consistent. Font sizes, buttons, and labelling must be consistent across the product to maintain visual consistency.

    - **Functional Consistency**

        Controls that function in the same way produce a consistent user interface. It improves the product's predictability. Users have a positive user experience. The key functions, such as navigation across the design, should work consistently throughout the product.

    - **Internal Consistency**

        The result of combining visual and functional consistency. It enhances the product's usability.

    - **External Consistency**

        When multiple products on multiple systems are designed in the same way, design consistency is achieved. There are Human Interface Guidelines, for example, for designing iOS applications. This removes a lot of friction and provides a great user experience.

- ### **HOW** to achieve design design consistency?

    There are numerous factors to consider when attempting to achieve consistency in your user interface. Here are five things you can do to improve the consistency of your designs:

    - **Your choice of language**

        The language you use in both marketing copy and wording used throughout the user flow can not only influence your users' perception of your product, but it can also be a source of confusion when different terminology is used to represent the same thing. This applies not only to the words you use, but also to the tone with which you deliver your message. Scaring your user with a serious and threatening error message while they are browsing an ecommerce site with an overall friendly tone will inevitably ruin an otherwise good user experience.

    - **Use the UI elements as they were designed**

        Commonly used UI elements, such as message windows, menu bars, icons, scrollbars, and radio buttons, are graphic elements that are typically consistent and have widely understood user representations. For example, radio buttons are intended to be used when only one option is available. Checkboxes, on the other hand, should be used only when the user has the option of selecting more than one option. One of the reasons is arguably the ease of application and ease of use that HTML5's consistency and standards in defining UI elements provide for developers, designers, and users.

    - **Consider multiple well-established layout conventions**

        It is certainly debatable whether a designer should "copy" how other people layout their websites or apps. When designing with the user's perspective and cognition in mind, it is critical to remember that humans have a strong memory for where things are visually located on the screen. You should take advantage of this feature by reserving commonly used locations for various graphical elements, such as the logo on the top left, the search field on the top right, the exit icon on the top right, and so on.

    - **Design for your user’s expectations**

        Make sure your site has the features and functionalities that users expect to see. A ticket-booking system, for example, should be available on an airline website, while a media player should be available on a music-sharing website.

    - **Consistent visual elements throughout the site**

        Content, UI elements, fonts, backgrounds, and colors should all be in harmony and feel the same at every touch point. Consistency can be achieved by adhering to HTML5 and CSS3 technical conventions. Having a branding and style guide to refer to when making design decisions, such as colors and fonts, is also helpful.

Consistency in UI is a massive undertaking, and it's all too easy for some details to fall through the cracks. The ultimate goal is, of course, a perfectly consistent and in-sync interface, but this isn't always possible right away. Even if the product has some inconsistencies at first, your team will be able to iron them out one by one as feedback is received.
