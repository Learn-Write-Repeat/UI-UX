### **Introduction to Wireframes**

> A wireframe is a quick and easy way to spot usability problems early in the design process. It's the skeleton of the page, displaying the 2-D representation of an interface with element spacings, content priority, functionalities, and user interactions, among other things. They also show the flow between pages, which helps to connect information architecture to the visual aspects of design.

> So, to put it another way, a wireframe is a low-fidelity, static representation of the various screens and pages that make up a product. Wireframes, according to [Adobe, are "stories about the future."](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/wireframing/wireframe-design-definition/) They serve the same purpose as a blueprint for a building.

- ### **What should be included in a wireframe and what should be excluded?**
    - Because the purpose of wireframing is to define the layout of different elements of the page as well as the page navigation, wireframes are meant to be simple. As a result, they have limited visual freedom because the majority of design elements such as media, colors, and real text aren't included. The following are some considerations to make when creating a wireframe:
    1. Your colours should be kept in grayscale.
    2. Instead of the square and rectangular placeholder, highly stylized graphics and media files should be avoided.
    3. A generic font should be used to avoid users being distracted by different styles. Font size and weight variations can be used to show the hierarchy of information.
    
- ### **Wireframing's primary goal**

    A wireframe's purpose is to lay the groundwork for the final design and to ensure that it contains all of the necessary elements.

    1. It's a great way to get your clients or users to think about what we want them to think about early on. We can easily guide them through the page structure without being distracted by styles or media. We can then easily show the client or user the elements, interactions, and functions, collect feedback, and improvise as needed.
    2. It assists us in mapping out the functionality of the pages, tracing problems earlier, and saving time on revisions later because a wireframe is much easier to change than a high-fidelity mockup with many design elements.
    3. Wireframes enable us to better relate to the client by allowing us to observe their thought process and observe their behaviors and inspirations.
    4. By revealing space constraints and designing the hierarchy of elements on the page, wireframes are a great way to priorities content. Having the ability to visualize the hierarchy of your pages and start visually displaying the space constraints early on will save you a lot of time later when it comes to styling and filling them with content. You should be gathering stakeholder feedback on your wireframes, quickly moving things around on your wireframes based on the feedback you receive, gathering feedback again, and iterating until you reach your desired outcome.

- ### **Wireframing's Limitations**
    1. Wireframes are not suitable for usability testing because they are schematic representations of the final design.
    2. When it comes to demonstrating concepts to stakeholders, it may not be as effective.
    3. Wireframes can't describe complex design ideas like animated effects, transitions, or gestures.

> Wireframes bring usability to the forefront, and they're a great way to show how pages are laid out and how the elements on the page work. Early in the design process, using wireframes forces you and your clients to look objectively at the ease of use, conversion paths, and element placement, as well as pointing out flaws. All of these factors contribute to products that are intuitive, functional, and enjoyable to use.
